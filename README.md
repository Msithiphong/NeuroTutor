# NeuroTutor - Your AI-Powered Personal Teacher üß†üìñüéôÔ∏è

NeuroTutor is an AI-driven personal tutor that enhances learning by leveraging the **Feynman technique**. It allows you to **upload class notes (PDFs), converse via microphone, and receive AI-powered explanations** that reference your materials and online sources.

## Features
‚úÖ **Upload & Extract Notes** ‚Äì Store class notes (PDFs) and retrieve relevant information.  
‚úÖ **Voice Interaction** ‚Äì Speak to your AI tutor using real-time speech-to-text.  
‚úÖ **Feynman-Based Learning** ‚Äì AI simplifies concepts by encouraging you to "teach" them.  
‚úÖ **Context-Aware Answers** ‚Äì AI references both your notes and online sources.  
‚úÖ **Seamless Integration** ‚Äì FastAPI backend with OpenAI GPT and Whisper for a smooth experience.  

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **AI Models**: OpenAI GPT, Whisper (Speech-to-Text)
- **Data Processing**: FAISS (Vector Search), PyMuPDF (PDF Parsing)
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (or React for scalability)
